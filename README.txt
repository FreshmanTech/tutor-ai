TutorAI Setup and Usage Guide

Welcome to TutorAI, your professional academic tutor bot!

Setup Instructions





Install Python: Ensure Python 3.12+ is installed from python.org. Verify with python --version in terminal.



Navigate to Folder: Open terminal, type cd C:\Users\mrsre\Desktop\tutorai, and press Enter.



Install Dependencies: Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install Gradio (5.44.1) and OpenAI (1.107.1).

API Key: The script uses a hardcoded OpenAI API key. For security, set an environment variable: set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key (Windows) before running, or edit app.py line 7.
